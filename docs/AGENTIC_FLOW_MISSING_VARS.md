# Agentic Flow - Missing Environment Variables

## Current Issue

Agent chat doesn't work because we haven't enabled the agentic-flow compilation yet.

## Why It's Excluded

The `src/services/agenticFlow.ts` imports `src/services/chartService.ts` which has TypeScript errors.

## Options

### Option 1: Fix chartService TypeScript errors
- Takes time
- May need more dependencies

### Option 2: Comment out chart functionality in agenticFlow
- Quick fix
- Agent modes still work (reports, research)
- Charts mode won't work until we fix chartService

### Option 3: Add environment variables you already have

You have all the required env vars for agent flow:
- ✅ `APIM_HOST` 
- ✅ `APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`
- ✅ `APIM_OPERATION`
- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY`

What's missing is DATABASE_URL for storing agent runs.

## Recommended: Option 2 (Quick Fix)

1. Comment out chart-related code in agenticFlow
2. Enable compilation
3. Deploy
4. Test agent modes (reports, research will work)
5. Fix charts later

## What You Need

Do you have `DATABASE_URL` in your App Runner environment variables?

If yes, we can enable agentic flow RIGHT NOW by:
1. Commenting out chart imports in agenticFlow
2. Compiling it
3. Deploying

This will give you:
- ✅ Reports mode
- ✅ Research mode  
- ❌ Charts mode (needs chartService fix)
