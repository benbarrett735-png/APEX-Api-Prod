## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. D3 Chart Builder (`src/utils/d3-chart-builder.ts`)

#### Pie Chart - Show Actual Amounts
```typescript
// BEFORE: Only showed labels
.text((d: any, i: number) => payload.x[i]);

// AFTER: Shows name, value, and percentage
.text((d: any, i: number) => {
  const value = values[i];
  const percentage = ((value / total) * 100).toFixed(1);
  return `${payload.x[i]}\n${value} (${percentage}%)`;
});
```

#### Radar Chart - Fix Centering
```typescript
// BEFORE: Chart appeared in top-left
const radius = Math.min(width, height - 100) / 2 - 80;
const g = svg.append('g')
  .attr('transform', `translate(${width / 2},${(height + 40) / 2}})`);

// AFTER: Properly centered
const radius = Math.min(width, height - 140) / 2 - 40;
const centerY = 70 + (height - 140) / 2; // Account for title
const g = svg.append('g')
  .attr('transform', `translate(${width / 2},${centerY})`);
```

---

### 2. Report Planning (`src/routes/reports.ts`)

#### Dynamic Web Search Limits
```typescript
// BEFORE: Fixed "1 search ONLY"
- ONLY use search_web if critical data is missing (limit to 1 search ONLY!)

// AFTER: Dynamic based on length
- Web searches: ${reportLength === 'short' ? '1-2 maximum' : 
                 reportLength === 'long' ? '3-4 maximum' : 
                 '2-3 maximum'} (ONLY if critical data missing!)
```

#### Efficiency Rules by Length
```typescript
// BEFORE: Fixed limits
- search_web: 0-1 calls ONLY
- Keep total tool calls under 8 steps

// AFTER: Dynamic limits
- search_web: ${reportLength === 'short' ? '1-2 calls' : 
               reportLength === 'long' ? '3-4 calls' : 
               '2-3 calls'} MAXIMUM
- Keep total tool calls under ${reportLength === 'short' ? '7' : 
                                reportLength === 'long' ? '12' : 
                                '10'} steps
```

#### Formatting Emphasis
```typescript
CRITICAL RULES FOR REPORTS:
- Reports are FORMAL BUSINESS ANALYSIS (paragraphs, not bullet points!)
- Charts should be placed INLINE with relevant sections (not dumped at end)
```

---

### 3. Section Drafting (`src/routes/reports.ts`, lines 921-944)

#### Paragraph-Only Format
```typescript
// BEFORE: System prompt
`Create clear, CONCISE sections with data-driven insights. 
 Use bullet points. Be direct.`

// BEFORE: User prompt
`Write a focused, data-driven section. 
 Use bullet points where appropriate.`

// AFTER: System prompt
`Write in PARAGRAPHS with professional, analytical prose. 
 NEVER use bullet points. 
 Integrate data smoothly into flowing text.`

// AFTER: User prompt
`CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Write in FLOWING PARAGRAPHS, NEVER use bullet points
- This is a FORMAL BUSINESS REPORT, not casual research notes
- Integrate data and insights naturally into prose
- Use analytical, professional tone
- Weave charts and data into the narrative`
```

---

### 4. Final Report Compilation (`src/routes/reports.ts`, lines 983-1026)

#### AI-Generated Title
```typescript
// BEFORE:
let finalReport = `# ${goal}\n\n`;
finalReport += `**Report Type:** ${plan.understanding.reportType}\n`;
finalReport += `**Generated:** ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}\n\n`;
finalReport += `---\n\n`;

// AFTER:
// Generate title using APIM
const titlePrompt = `Generate a professional, formal title for this business report 
                     (maximum 12 words)...`;
const titleResponse = await callAPIM([...]);
const reportTitle = generatedTitle || goal; // Fallback to goal

let finalReport = `# ${reportTitle}\n\n`; // Clean header, no metadata
```

#### Cleaner Chart Display
```typescript
// BEFORE: Verbose error display
if (chart.failed) {
  finalReport += `> ⚠️ **Chart Generation Failed**\n`;
  finalReport += `> Type: ${chart.type}\n`;
  if (chart.error) {
    finalReport += `> Error: ${chart.error}\n`;
  }
}

// AFTER: Simple, clean
if (chart.failed) {
  finalReport += `*Chart generation failed (${chart.type})*\n\n`;
} else {
  finalReport += `![${chart.type} chart](${chart.url})\n\n`;
}
```
