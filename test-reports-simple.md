# Reports Flow Test

## ✅ Build Status: SUCCESSFUL
All TypeScript compiled successfully.

## 🔧 Changes Made:

### Templates Regeneration
- Fixed: Feedback is now optional (was required before)
- Fixed: Using `feedbackText` variable consistently

### Reports  
- Added: 5-minute timeout protection
- Added: Per-tool error handling (one tool failure won't kill entire report)
- Fixed: Better error logging

### Charts
- Fixed: Regeneration now uses `agentic_events` instead of non-existent metadata column

### All Modes
- Added: Conversation history support for follow-up chat

## 🧪 TESTING REPORTS END-TO-END

### Manual Test (Frontend):
1. Go to Reports section in UI
2. Enter goal: "Analyze Tesla market position 2024"
3. Select length: Medium
4. Add chart: Bar chart
5. Click Generate

### What to Watch For:

**✅ Success Indicators:**
- Stream connects immediately
- You see "thinking" events
- You see "tool.call" events (search_web, draft_section, etc.)
- Report completes with markdown content
- Charts embedded in report (if requested)

**❌ Failure Indicators:**
- Timeout after 5 minutes (will see error in UI)
- Stream never connects
- No events appear
- Stuck on one tool forever

### Check Logs:
```bash
# If using pm2:
pm2 logs apex-api --lines 100

# Or check terminal where API is running
```

**Look for these log patterns:**

Good:
```
[Reports] Starting generation
[Reports] PHASE 1: Creating report plan
[Reports] Plan created: {...}
[Reports] PHASE 2: Executing plan
[Reports] ⚙️ Executing: search_web
[Reports] ✅ Search completed
[Reports] PHASE 3: Compiling final report
[Reports] ✅ Report completed
```

Bad:
```
[Reports] TIMEOUT after 5 minutes
[Reports] Generation error: ...
[Reports] ❌ Tool execution failed: ...
```

## 🎯 REGENERATION TEST

After reports completes:

1. Click "Regenerate" button
2. Enter feedback: "make it more concise"
3. Click submit

**Expected:**
- New run ID created
- Goes through SAME flow (planning → execution → completion)
- Original report + feedback injected in system prompt
- New version generated

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Reports** - Run it through UI, check logs
2. **Test Regeneration** - Try regenerating each mode
3. **Report back** - What actually happens?

If reports timeout or fail, check the logs for the EXACT error message - that will tell us where to fix.
