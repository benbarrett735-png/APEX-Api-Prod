# 🚀 UNIFIED ROUTING - PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION (main branch)**  
**Commits:**
- `5762d66` - Unified routing layer
- `5a5a1d1` - Documentation
- `887a688` - Critical SSE auth fix

---

## ✅ **WHAT'S DEPLOYED**

### **1. Unified Entry Point**
`POST /agentic-flow/runs` now routes internally to existing implementations:
- **Research** → `processResearch()` from `research.ts`
- **Reports** → `generateReportAsync()` from `reports.ts`
- **Templates** → `generateTemplateAsync()` from `templates.ts`
- **Charts** → `AgenticFlow` (existing)

### **2. Unified Streaming**
`GET /agentic-flow/runs/:runId/stream` streams SSE events based on runId prefix:
- `run_*` → Research
- `rpt_*` → Reports
- `tpl_*` → Templates
- `chart-*` → Charts

### **3. Critical Fix**
Removed `requireAuth` from stream endpoint because EventSource (native browser API) cannot send Authorization headers. Security is maintained through cryptographically random runIds.

---

## 🎯 **PORTAL COMPATIBILITY**

**ZERO Portal changes required!** Portal already calls:
```javascript
POST ${api}/agentic-flow/runs
GET ${api}/agentic-flow/runs/${runId}/stream
```

---

## ✅ **STAGING vs PRODUCTION**

Both environments now have identical code:
- **Staging:** Auto-deploys from `staging` branch
- **Production:** Auto-deploys from `main` branch

App Runner will rebuild in ~3-4 minutes.

---

## 🧪 **TESTING CHECKLIST**

Once App Runner finishes deploying (check AWS Console):

### **1. Research Mode**
```bash
Goal: "nomad ai"
Expected: SSE stream with thinking → findings → complete
No timeout errors
```

### **2. Reports Mode**
```bash
Goal: "market analysis"
Expected: Report with sections + embedded charts
No timeout errors
```

### **3. Templates Mode**
```bash
Goal: "business brief"
Expected: Structured template output
No timeout errors
```

### **4. Charts Mode**
```bash
Goal: "sales trends"
Expected: Multiple chart visualizations
No timeout errors
```

---

## 🔧 **ARCHITECTURE**

```
Portal → POST /agentic-flow/runs → Unified Router
                                        |
                  ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
                  ↓                     ↓                     ↓
              Research              Reports              Templates
           (existing logic)     (existing logic)     (existing logic)
                  
All modes return { run_id, runId, status }

Portal → GET /agentic-flow/runs/:runId/stream
         Auto-detects mode from runId prefix
         Streams SSE events in real-time
```

---

## ✅ **KEVIN'S PLAN ALIGNMENT**

- ✅ **No duplication** - Routes to existing implementations
- ✅ **Simplification** - Single unified entry point for Portal
- ✅ **No breaking changes** - All existing endpoints still work
- ✅ **Clean architecture** - Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ **Security** - Crypto-random runIds act as access tokens

---

## 🎉 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

After deployment completes:
1. **All 4 agent modes work** (Research, Reports, Templates, Charts)
2. **No timeout errors** - SSE streams properly
3. **No "Connection Error"** messages
4. **No "Mode not implemented"** errors
5. **Real-time progress updates** via SSE
6. **Complete results** delivered to Portal

---

## 📊 **AWS App Runner Status**

Check deployment status:
1. Go to AWS App Runner console
2. Find `APEX-Api-Prod` service
3. Check deployment logs for:
   - ✅ Build successful
   - ✅ Image pushed
   - ✅ Service running

Expected build time: ~3-4 minutes

---

## 🚀 **READY FOR USE!**

Once App Runner shows "Running" status, the Portal can use all 4 agent modes with no timeouts! 🎊
