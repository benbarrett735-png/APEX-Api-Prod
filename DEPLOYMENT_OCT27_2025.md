## 📦 What's Being Deployed

### **Critical Bug Fixes**

**1. Charts Chat/Regeneration** (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Was:** `Error: column "full_report" does not exist` - completely broken
- ✅ **Now:** Charts correctly use `agentic_artifacts` table
- ✅ **Now:** Regeneration works with feedback injection
- ✅ **Now:** Mode correctly set to 'charts' (not 'reports')
- ✅ **Now:** Titles clean (no newlines breaking markdown)

**2. Research Regeneration** (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Was:** Crashed immediately with JSON parse error
- ✅ **Now:** Proper type checking, no crashes
- ✅ **Now:** Regeneration runs full flow with feedback
- ✅ **Now:** Shows regeneration indicators

**3. Reports Improvements**
- ✅ **Added:** 5-minute timeout protection (no infinite loading)
- ✅ **Added:** Chart failure handling (continues instead of crash)
- ✅ **Added:** Web search fallback for chart data
- ✅ **Added:** Synthetic data generation when needed

**4. Chat Conversation History**
- ✅ **Added:** All modes support multi-turn conversations
- ✅ **Added:** Context maintained across follow-ups

## 🚨 Known Issues (Not Blockers)

**1. APIM Slowness**
- **Issue:** APIM sometimes takes 4+ minutes per call
- **Impact:** Reports may timeout
- **Cause:** Azure infrastructure, not code
- **Mitigation:** Timeout protection catches it

**2. Chart Data Mismatches**
- **Issue:** Document doesn't have chart-relevant data
- **Impact:** Chart may fail or use synthetic data
- **Cause:** AI planning limitations
- **Mitigation:** Fallback logic + error handling
