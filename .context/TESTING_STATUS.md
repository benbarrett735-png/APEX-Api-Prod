## üß™ HOW TO TEST

### Option 1: Automated Test Script

```bash
# Start the API
cd /Users/benbarrett/APEX-Api-Prod
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the test script
cd /Users/benbarrett/APEX-Api-Prod
./test-remaining-charts.sh
```

**Script will test all 8 charts and show:**
- ‚úÖ SUCCESS with chart URL
- ‚ùå FAILED with error message

---

### Option 2: Manual Testing via Frontend

Test each chart type in the UI with prompt: **"ai usage in the world"**

1. Go to your app
2. Request chart generation
3. Select chart type from dropdown
4. Enter prompt: "ai usage in the world"
5. Click generate
6. Check if chart appears or error shows

---

### Option 3: Manual cURL Commands

```bash
# Test AREA
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/charts/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chartType":"area","data":{},"goal":"ai usage in the world"}'

# Test BUBBLE
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/charts/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chartType":"bubble","data":{},"goal":"ai usage in the world"}'

# Test SUNBURST
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/charts/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chartType":"sunburst","data":{},"goal":"ai usage in the world"}'

# Test CANDLESTICK
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/charts/generate \

  -d '{"chartType":"candlestick","data":{},"goal":"ai usage in the world"}'

# Test FLOW
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/charts/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chartType":"flow","data":{},"goal":"ai usage in the world"}'

# Test STACKBAR
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/charts/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chartType":"stackbar","data":{},"goal":"ai usage in the world"}'

# Test THEMERIVER
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/charts/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chartType":"themeriver","data":{},"goal":"ai usage in the world"}'

# Test WORDCLOUD

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS

### All 8 Should Work Because:

1. **AREA, BUBBLE, STACKBAR, THEMERIVER**
   - Standard charts (x + series)
   - No complex prompts
   - No special structures
   - Should work like BAR, LINE, SCATTER ‚úÖ

2. **CANDLESTICK, FLOW**
   - Just fixed with simplified prompts
   - Added user prompt instructions
   - Same fixes that worked for SANKEY, GANTT ‚úÖ

3. **SUNBURST, WORDCLOUD**
   - Have normalization to fix APIM mistakes
   - Fallback data if needed
   - Should work like TREEMAP, FUNNEL ‚úÖ

---

## üö® IF ANY FAIL

### Check Logs For:
1. **APIM timeout** (after 30s)
   - Log: `[ChartService] APIM request timed out after 30s`
   - Solution: Prompt might still be too complex

2. **Python timeout** (after 60s)
   - Log: `[ChartService] Python execution timed out after 60s`
   - Solution: Python script might have issue

3. **Invalid JSON**
   - Log: `[ChartService] Failed to parse APIM response`
   - Log: `[ChartService] Raw content: ...`
   - Solution: Prompt mismatch, need to add user prompt

4. **Missing fields**
   - Log: `Python execution failed: missing X`
   - Solution: Normalization needs to create that field
