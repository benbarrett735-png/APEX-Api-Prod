# File Content Integration - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Issue:** ADI extracts file content, but API wasn't using it  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## What Was Wrong

**Portal Flow:**
1. User uploads file
2. Portal sends to ADI (Azure Document Intelligence)
3. ADI extracts text content
4. Portal sends to API: `{ uploadId, fileName, content }`

**API Before:**
```typescript
uploaded_files: [{ uploadId, fileName }] // ❌ Ignored content!
```

**Result:** API couldn't process files, always fell back to web search

---

## What Was Fixed

### **1. Updated Request Interface**
```typescript
interface ResearchStartRequest {
  uploaded_files?: Array<{ 
    uploadId: string; 
    fileName: string;
    content?: string; // ✅ Now accepts ADI-extracted content
  }>;
}
```

### **2. Document Analysis Logic**
```typescript
if (uploadedFiles.length > 0) {
  // Check for files with content
  const filesWithContent = uploadedFiles.filter(f => f.content?.trim());
  
  if (filesWithContent.length > 0) {
    // Combine all documents
    const combinedContent = filesWithContent
      .map(f => `### ${f.fileName}\n\n${f.content}`)
      .join('\n\n---\n\n');
    
    // Analyze with APIM
    const analysis = await generateSectionSummary(
      'Document Analysis',
      [combinedContent]
    );
    
    // Extract findings
    const findings = analysis
      .split('\n')
      .filter(line => line.trim().length > 20)
      .map(line => `[From Uploaded Documents] ${line}`)
      .slice(0, 10);
    
    allFindings.push(...findings);
    sources.push(...filesWithContent.map(f => `Uploaded: ${f.fileName}`));
  }
}
```

### **3. SSE Events**
```typescript
emit('thinking', {
  thought: 'Analyzing 1 uploaded document...',
  thought_type: 'analyzing'
});

emit('tool.call', {
  tool: 'document_analysis',
  purpose: 'Analyze uploaded documents'
});

emit('tool.result', {
  tool: 'document_analysis',
  findings_count: 8,
  key_insights: 'Extracted 8 key insights from uploaded documents'
});
```

---

## How It Works Now

### **Portal → API Flow**

**Portal sends:**
```json
POST /research/start
{
  "query": "Summarize this document",
  "depth": "medium",
  "uploaded_files": [
    {
      "uploadId": "abc123",
      "fileName": "report.pdf",
      "content": "This is the extracted text from the PDF... [5000 chars]"
    }
  ]
}
```

**API processes:**
1. Receives files with content ✅
2. Combines content from all files
3. Sends to APIM for analysis
4. APIM extracts key findings
5. Adds findings to research results
6. Complements with web search (if configured)
7. Generates comprehensive report

---

## Example Flow

**User uploads:** `quarterly-report.pdf`

**API thinking:**
```
[Analyzing] Analyzing 1 uploaded document...
[Tool Call] document_analysis - Analyze uploaded documents
[Tool Result] document_analysis → Found 8 items
             Extracted 8 key insights from uploaded documents
[Thinking] Extracted 8 key findings from your uploaded documents.
           Let me complement this with external research.
[Tool Call] openai_search - Search public web
[Tool Result] openai_search → Found 5 items
[Synthesizing] Synthesizing 13 findings from 6 sources...
```

**Report includes:**
```markdown
## Key Findings

1. [From Uploaded Documents] Q3 revenue increased 25% YoY...
2. [From Uploaded Documents] Operating expenses decreased 12%...
3. [From Uploaded Documents] Customer acquisition cost improved...
...
8. [From Uploaded Documents] Projected growth for Q4...
9. [From Web Search] Industry average growth rate is 18%...
10. [From Web Search] Competitor analysis shows...
```

---

## Error Handling

**Scenario 1: No Content Provided**
```typescript
if (filesWithContent.length === 0) {
  emit('thinking', {
    thought: 'Files uploaded but content not available yet. Proceeding with web research.',
    thought_type: 'planning'
  });
}
```

**Scenario 2: APIM Analysis Fails**
```typescript
catch (error) {
  emit('tool.result', {
    tool: 'document_analysis',
    findings_count: 0,
    key_insights: `Analysis failed: ${error.message}. Proceeding with web research.`
  });
}
```

**Result:** Research continues, never crashes

---

## Portal Integration Required

**Portal needs to send content:**
```typescript
// After ADI extraction
const uploadedFiles = [{
  uploadId: pollData.uploadId,
  fileName: file.name,
  content: pollData.extractedText // ✅ Include this!
}];

// Send to API
fetch('/research/start', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query,
    depth,
    uploaded_files: uploadedFiles // With content
  })
});
```

---

## Benefits

✅ **Works with ADI:** Uses extracted text directly  
✅ **No database needed:** Content sent in request  
✅ **Combines sources:** Documents + web search  
✅ **Tagged findings:** `[From Uploaded Documents]` vs `[From Web Search]`  
✅ **Graceful fallback:** If no content, still does web search  
✅ **Production-ready:** Error handling, logging, SSE events  

---

## Testing

**Test with file upload:**

1. **Upload a PDF** via Portal
2. **Portal extracts text** with ADI
3. **Portal sends to API** with content
4. **API analyzes** using APIM
5. **User sees:**
   ```
   Analyzing 1 uploaded document...
   → Found 8 key insights
   Complementing with web research...
   → Found 5 more insights
   Report: 13 total findings
   ```

**Expected output:** Report with both document findings and web research

---

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `src/routes/research.ts`
  - Updated `ResearchStartRequest` interface
  - Added document analysis logic
  - APIM integration for file processing
  - SSE events for transparency

**New:**
- `.context/FILE_CONTENT_INTEGRATION.md` (this file)

---

## Alignment with Kevin's Plan

✅ **No new database tables:** Uses request payload  
✅ **Reuses existing services:** `generateSectionSummary` (APIM)  
✅ **Production-grade:** Error handling, logging  
✅ **App Runner ready:** No local dependencies  
✅ **Stateless:** Content in request, not stored  

---

## Next Steps

**Portal Side:**
```typescript
// ✅ Already done in Portal (ADI extraction works)
// ✅ Just need to send content in request

const pollData = await adiPoll(analyzeResult.resultId);
const extractedText = pollData.extractedText; // ✅ This exists

// Send to API
fetch('/research/start', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    uploaded_files: [{
      uploadId,
      fileName,
      content: extractedText // ✅ Include this
    }]
  })
});
```

---

**Status:** ✅ API ready to receive and process file content  
**Blocked by:** Portal needs to send `content` field in request  
**ETA:** Portal change is ~5 lines of code, test immediately
