# Phase 1 Status: DEPLOYED ✅

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Commit:** `b18cea0`  
**Status:** Pushed to GitHub `staging` branch  
**App Runner:** Deployment in progress (~3-5 minutes)

---

## What Was Deployed

### ✅ Files Added
- `migrations/023_research_runs.sql` - Database schema (o1_research_runs, o1_research_activities)
- `src/routes/research.ts` - POST /research/start, GET /research/stream/:id
- `docs/PHASE_1_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment instructions
- `docs/RESEARCH_MODE_README.md` - Complete documentation

### ✅ Features
- SSE streaming infrastructure
- 6 event types (thinking, tool.call, tool.result, section.completed, research.completed, error)
- Hardcoded events for testing Portal connection
- Auth via existing JWKS middleware
- No new environment variables

### ✅ Alignment with Kevin's Plan
- All business logic in API (not Portal)
- Uses existing DATABASE_URL, APIM_HOST, OPENAI_API_KEY
- PostgreSQL with proper indexes
- TypeScript → compiles to dist/
- Automatic deployment via GitHub push

## Next Steps (CRITICAL)

### 1. Wait for App Runner Deployment (3-5 min)

Monitor: https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/home?region=eu-west-1#/services/apex-api-staging

**Wait for status:** `Running`

### 2. Run Database Migration

**CRITICAL:** Must run migration in staging RDS after deployment

```bash
# Option 1: AWS RDS Query Editor
# Navigate to RDS → Query Editor
# Connect to: nomad-apex-db
# Paste and run: migrations/023_research_runs.sql

# Option 2: psql (if you have bastion access)
psql "postgresql://apex_admin:PASSWORD@nomad-apex-db.cxe4igg44f5w.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/apex" \
  -f migrations/023_research_runs.sql
```

### 3. Verify Health Check

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://gzejipnqbh.eu-west-1.awsapprunner.com/research/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "module": "research",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "phase": 1,
  "dependencies": {
    "database": true,
    "research_table": true,
    "apim": true,
    "openai": true
  }
}
```

### 4. Test from Portal Staging

1. Go to: https://staging.d2umjimd2ilqq7.amplifyapp.com
2. Login
3. Navigate to `/chat`
4. Select "Research" mode
5. Enter query: "Test research system"
6. Click Send

**Expected:**
- Thinking events appear in real-time
- Tool call animations
- Section completed notifications
- Final report displays

## Phase 1 Success Criteria

- [x] TypeScript compiles
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] Committed to git
- [x] Pushed to GitHub staging
- [ ] **App Runner deployment complete**
- [ ] **Migration run in staging**
- [ ] **Health check passes**
- [ ] **Portal test successful**

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Rollback

```bash
# Revert the commit
cd /Users/benbarrett/APEX-Api-Prod
git revert b18cea0
git push origin staging

# Drop tables (if needed)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS o1_research_activities CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS o1_research_runs CASCADE;
```

### Check Logs

```bash
# App Runner logs
# https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/home?region=eu-west-1#/services/apex-api-staging/logs

# Look for:
# - "[Research] " prefix in logs
# - Database connection errors
# - SSE streaming errors
```

---

## After Phase 1 Verified

Once Portal test is successful, proceed to Phase 2:

**Phase 2: APIM Integration**
- Retrieve file content by uploadId
- Call APIM for real analysis
- Generate dynamic reports
- Emit real thinking events (not hardcoded)

## Current Branch State

```
staging branch: 11 commits ahead of origin/staging (before push)
After push: origin/staging updated
Latest commit: b18cea0 (Phase 1)
```

**Status:** ✅ Code deployed, waiting for:
1. App Runner deployment to finish
2. Database migration to run
3. Portal testing

**ETA:** Ready to test in ~5-10 minutes
