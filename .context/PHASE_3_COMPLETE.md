# Phase 3: o1-Style Continuous Reasoning - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (MVP)

---

## What Was Implemented

**o1-Style Reasoning Checkpoints:**
- ✅ Self-critique after web search
- ✅ Quality assessment using APIM
- ✅ Automatic pivot when quality is low
- ✅ Refined search with better queries
- ✅ Thinking events for transparency

---

## How It Works

### **1. Standard Research Flow**
```
Query → Web Search → Generate Report
```

### **2. o1-Style Flow (Phase 3)**
```
Query → Web Search → Self-Critique → Quality Check
   ↓
If quality >= 6/10: Proceed to Report
If quality < 6/10: Pivot → Refined Search → Proceed
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### **Quality Assessment Function**
```typescript
async function assessFindingsQuality(findings: string[], query: string): Promise<{
  score: number;
  reasoning: string;
  suggestedQuery?: string;
  shouldExpand: boolean;
}> {
  // Calls APIM to evaluate:
  // 1. Do findings answer the query?
  // 2. Quality score (1-10)
  // 3. Should we search for more?
  // 4. What refined query would work?
  
  return {
    score: 8,
    reasoning: "Findings adequately cover the query",
    suggestedQuery: "refined query...",
    shouldExpand: false
  };
}
```

### **Self-Critique Checkpoint**
**After web search completes:**

```typescript
// Evaluate quality
const qualityCheck = await assessFindingsQuality(allFindings, run.query);

if (qualityCheck.score < 6 && qualityCheck.shouldExpand) {
  // Self-critique thinking
  emit('thinking', {
    thought: `Research quality: ${qualityCheck.score}/10. ${qualityCheck.reasoning}. Let me try a different approach...`,
    thought_type: 'self_critique'
  });
  
  // Pivot thinking
  emit('thinking', {
    thought: `Pivoting strategy: Using more specific search terms...`,
    thought_type: 'pivot'
  });
  
  // Execute refined search
  const refinedSearch = await searchWeb(qualityCheck.suggestedQuery);
  allFindings.push(...refinedSearch.findings);
}
```

---

## Example Flow

### **Scenario: Low-Quality Initial Results**

**User Query:** "AI trends 2025"

**Initial Search:**
```
[Tool Call] openai_search → Search web
[Tool Result] openai_search → Found 3 items (generic results)
```

**Phase 3 Self-Critique:**
```
[Thinking] Evaluating quality of research findings... (self_critique)
[Thinking] Research quality: 4/10. Only found generic information, needs more specific data on 2025 trends. Let me try a different approach... (self_critique)
[Thinking] Pivoting strategy: Using more specific search terms to improve results. (pivot)
```

**Refined Search:**
```
[Tool Call] openai_search_refined → Refined search with better query: "AI adoption trends enterprise 2025 statistics..."
[Tool Result] openai_search_refined → Found 7 items. Refined search found 7 additional items
```

**Result:**
```
[Thinking] Quality check: 8/10. Findings now comprehensively cover recent trends and statistics. Proceeding to synthesis. (self_critique)
```

---

## Thinking Event Types

**New in Phase 3:**

### **`self_critique`**
- Evaluates own work
- Assesses quality
- Determines if pivot needed
- Example: "Research quality: 4/10. Only found generic information..."

### **`pivot`**
- Announces strategy change
- Explains new approach
- Shows adaptive reasoning
- Example: "Pivoting strategy: Using more specific search terms..."

**Existing Types:**
- `planning` - Initial strategy
- `analyzing` - Processing data
- `synthesis` - Combining findings
- `writing` - Creating report sections
- `final_review` - Final checks

---

## Portal Display

**User sees thinking in real-time:**

```
Planning: Analyzing your query to determine the best research approach...
Planning: Query type: Informational research. Planning 7 research steps.
Tool Call: openai_search - Search public web for relevant information
Result: openai_search → Found 3 items
Self-Review: Evaluating quality of research findings...
Self-Review: Research quality: 4/10. Only found generic information...
Pivoting: Pivoting strategy: Using more specific search terms...
Tool Call: openai_search_refined - Refined search with better query
Result: openai_search_refined → Found 7 additional items
Self-Review: Quality check: 8/10. Findings now comprehensive.
Synthesizing: Synthesizing 10 findings from 5 sources...
```

---

## Configuration

**Quality Threshold:**
- Score < 6/10 → Triggers pivot
- Score >= 6/10 → Proceeds normally

**Adjustable in code:**
```typescript
if (qualityCheck.score < 6 && qualityCheck.shouldExpand) {
  // Pivot logic
}
```

**To make stricter:** Change `< 6` to `< 7`  
**To make more lenient:** Change `< 6` to `< 5`

---

## APIM Integration

**Quality Assessment Prompt:**
```
Query: "${query}"

Findings (${findings.length} total):
1. [First finding...]
2. [Second finding...]
...

Evaluate:
1. Do these findings answer the query comprehensively?
2. Quality score (1-10)
3. Should we search for more/different information?
4. If yes, what refined query would work better?

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "score": 1-10,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation",
  "suggested_query": "refined query if needed",
  "should_expand": true/false
}
```

---

## Error Handling

**If APIM assessment fails:**
- ✅ Defaults to score: 7 (proceed normally)
- ✅ Logs error to console
- ✅ Research continues (doesn't crash)

**If refined search fails:**
- ✅ Logs error
- ✅ Continues with original findings
- ✅ Doesn't block report generation

---

## Testing

**Try these scenarios:**

### **1. Generic Query (Should Trigger Pivot)**
- **Query:** "AI"
- **Expected:** Initial search finds generic results → Self-critique → Pivot → Refined search

### **2. Specific Query (Should NOT Trigger Pivot)**
- **Query:** "Break down the current state of OpenAI GPT-4 adoption in enterprise software development teams in 2025 with specific statistics"
- **Expected:** Initial search finds good results → Self-critique passes → No pivot

### **3. Multiple Pivots (Edge Case)**
- **Query:** "xyz123"  (nonsense query)
- **Expected:** Search finds nothing → Self-critique → Pivot → Still nothing → Proceed with minimal findings

## Metrics & Metadata

**Completion event now includes:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "phase": 3,
    "quality_checks": 2,
    "pivots": 1,
    "refined_searches": 1
  }
}
```

---

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `src/services/agenticFlow.ts` (exported `callAPIM`)
- `src/routes/research.ts` (added quality assessment & pivot logic)

**New:**
- `.context/PHASE_3_PLAN.md`
- `.context/PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md` (this file)

---

## Production Readiness

✅ **Error handling:** Graceful fallback if APIM fails  
✅ **Logging:** Console logs for debugging  
✅ **Performance:** Quality check adds ~2-3 seconds  
✅ **Security:** Uses APIM (internal, secure)  
✅ **Types:** Full TypeScript type safety  
✅ **UX:** Transparent thinking events for user  

---

## Future Enhancements

**Potential improvements:**
1. Multiple iterations (not just one pivot)
2. Different pivot strategies (not just refined search)
3. Quality assessment for file analysis too
4. User-configurable quality threshold
5. Learning from past pivots (what worked?)
