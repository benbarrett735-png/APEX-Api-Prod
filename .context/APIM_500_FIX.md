# APIM 500 ERROR FIX - User Prompt Mismatch

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Issue:** FLOW, GANTT, SANKEY getting APIM 500 errors  
**Root Cause:** User prompt (x/series) ‚â† System prompt (nodes/edges/tasks)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üêõ THE PROBLEM

### Error Message
```
Error: APIM request failed: 500 - { 
  "statusCode": 500, 
  "message": "Internal server error"
}
```

### Root Cause
APIM receives **TWO prompts**:
1. **System Prompt** (via `getSystemPrompt`) - defines chart schema
2. **User Prompt** (via `buildFormatterPrompt`) - explains what to create

**THE MISMATCH:**
- System prompt for FLOW: "Return nodes[{id, label, type}], edges[{from, to}]"
- User prompt for FLOW: "Return x[], series[] with standard chart structure"  
  ‚Üì  
  **APIM confused ‚Üí 500 error**

## üìã AFFECTED CHART TYPES

### Charts with Mismatch

| Chart | System Prompt Expects | User Prompt Was Asking For | Result |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| FLOW | nodes, edges | x, series | ‚ùå 500 |
| GANTT | tasks | x, series | ‚ùå 500 |
| SANKEY | nodes, links | x, series | ‚ùå 500 |

### Why This Happened
These 3 charts were NOT in the `if/else` chain in `buildFormatterPrompt()`, so they fell into the default "standard chart" case that asks for x/series.

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX

### Added Chart-Specific User Prompts

#### 1. FLOW (lines 1542-1558)
```typescript
if (chartType === 'flow') {
  prompt += `Create a process flow diagram with nodes and edges.
If the user's goal doesn't clearly describe a process, create a generic flow that represents their topic.

Required JSON structure:
{
  "title": "chart title",
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "1", "label": "Start", "type": "start"},
    {"id": "2", "label": "Process", "type": "process"},
    {"id": "3", "label": "End", "type": "end"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"from": "1", "to": "2"},
    {"from": "2", "to": "3"}
  ]
}`;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Matches system prompt (nodes, edges)
- ‚úÖ Handles vague goals gracefully
- ‚úÖ Shows exact structure with example

---

#### 2. GANTT (lines 1559-1570)
```typescript
else if (chartType === 'gantt') {
  prompt += `Create a timeline with tasks and date ranges.
If the user's goal doesn't clearly describe tasks, create a generic timeline that represents their topic over time.

Required JSON structure:
{
  "title": "chart title",
  "tasks": [
    {"label": "Task 1", "start": "2024-01-01", "end": "2024-01-15"},
    {"label": "Task 2", "start": "2024-01-10", "end": "2024-02-01"}
  ]
}`;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Matches system prompt (tasks)
- ‚úÖ Handles vague goals by creating timeline
- ‚úÖ Shows ISO date format

---

#### 3. SANKEY (lines 1571-1585)
```typescript
else if (chartType === 'sankey') {
  prompt += `Create a flow diagram showing relationships between sources and targets.
Create nodes for categories and links for flows between them.

Required JSON structure:
{
  "title": "chart title",
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "a", "label": "Source A", "col": 0},
    {"id": "b", "label": "Target B", "col": 1}
  ],
  "links": [
    {"source": "a", "target": "b", "value": 100}
  ]
}`;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Matches system prompt (nodes, links)
- ‚úÖ Explains column structure
- ‚úÖ Shows exact structure with example

---

## üîç HOW IT WORKS NOW

### The Two-Prompt System

#### System Prompt (getSystemPrompt)
**Purpose:** Define schema/structure  
**Example for FLOW:**
```
FLOW:
  keys: title?, nodes[{id, label, type}], edges[{from, to}], options?
  Example: {nodes: [{id:"1", label:"Start", type:"start"}], edges: [{from:"1", to:"2"}]}
```

#### User Prompt (buildFormatterPrompt)
**Purpose:** Explain what to create from user's data  
**Example for FLOW:**
```
Create a process flow diagram with nodes and edges.
If the user's goal doesn't clearly describe a process, create a generic flow that represents their topic.

Required JSON structure:
{nodes: [...], edges: [...]}
```

### Why Both Are Needed
- **System prompt:** "This is the format"
- **User prompt:** "This is what to create in that format"
- **Together:** APIM understands both structure AND intent

## üß™ TESTING

### Before Fix
```bash
# Request: "ai usage in the last year - flow chart"
Result: ‚ùå APIM 500 error
Cause: System prompt wants nodes/edges, user prompt asks for x/series
```

### After Fix
```bash
# Request: "ai usage in the last year - flow chart"
Expected: ‚úÖ APIM returns {nodes: [...], edges: [...]}
         ‚úÖ Creates generic flow about AI usage
         ‚úÖ Chart generates successfully
```

## üìä ALL CHART TYPES - PROMPT STATUS

| # | Chart | System Prompt | User Prompt | Status |
|---|-------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 1-6 | Standard | x, series | x, series | ‚úÖ Match |
| 7 | FUNNEL | stages | stages | ‚úÖ Match |
| 8 | HEATMAP | data, xlabels | x, series | ‚ö†Ô∏è Normalized |
| 9 | RADAR | axes, series | axes, series | ‚úÖ Match |
| 10 | SANKEY | nodes, links | **FIXED** ‚Üí nodes, links | ‚úÖ Match |
| 11 | SUNBURST | root | x, series | ‚ö†Ô∏è Normalized |
| 12 | TREEMAP | items | x, series | ‚ö†Ô∏è Normalized |
| 13 | CANDLESTICK | data | x, series | ‚ö†Ô∏è Normalized |
| 14 | FLOW | nodes, edges | **FIXED** ‚Üí nodes, edges | ‚úÖ Match |
| 15 | GANTT | tasks | **FIXED** ‚Üí tasks | ‚úÖ Match |
| 16-18 | Standard | x, series | x, series | ‚úÖ Match |

**Note:** Charts marked "‚ö†Ô∏è Normalized" have user prompts asking for x/series but normalization converts to correct structure. This works but is less efficient than asking for correct structure upfront.

---

## üöÄ IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITY

### Could Also Add User Prompts For
- **SUNBURST** - Ask for root/children instead of x/series
- **TREEMAP** - Ask for items instead of x/series (though recently fixed)
- **CANDLESTICK** - Ask for OHLC data instead of x/series
- **HEATMAP** - Ask for 2D array instead of x/series

**Why?** More efficient - APIM creates correct structure instead of relying on normalization fixes.

**Priority:** Low - normalization works, but user prompts would be cleaner.

## üß™ HOW TO TEST

### Test FLOW
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/charts/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chartType": "flow",
    "data": {},
    "goal": "ai usage in the last year"
  }'
```

**Expected:**
```
[ChartService] Calling APIM for chart: flow
[ChartService] User prompt includes: "Create a process flow diagram with nodes and edges"
[ChartService] APIM returned: {nodes: [...], edges: [...]}
[ChartService] ‚úÖ Chart generated successfully
```

### Test GANTT
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/charts/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chartType": "gantt",
    "data": {},
    "goal": "ai usage in the last year"
  }'
```

**Expected:**
```
[ChartService] Calling APIM for chart: gantt
[ChartService] User prompt includes: "Create a timeline with tasks and date ranges"
[ChartService] APIM returned: {tasks: [...]}
[ChartService] ‚úÖ Chart generated successfully
```

## üéØ KEY TAKEAWAY

**ALWAYS ensure system prompt and user prompt match:**
- If system prompt says "nodes", user prompt should ask for "nodes"
- If system prompt says "tasks", user prompt should ask for "tasks"
- Don't rely on normalization to fix prompt mismatches - fix at the source

**This prevents APIM confusion and 500 errors.**
