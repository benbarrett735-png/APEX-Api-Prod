# Kevin's Infrastructure Plan - API Repository Status

**Repository:** APEX-Api-Prod  
**Branch:** staging  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Current Phase:** Stage 3 - API Migration

---

## Overview

This is Kevin's phased infrastructure simplification plan for the Nomad APEX platform. We're migrating from a monorepo with manual Elastic Beanstalk deployments to standalone repositories with automated CI/CD via AWS App Runner/Amplify.

**Overall Goal:** 70% reduction in deployment complexity, sub-5-minute deployments, $324/year cost savings

---

## Phase Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Quick Wins (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** Add automation to existing infrastructure  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Status:** Done by team (not in this repo)

- ✅ GitHub Actions for deployments
- ✅ Automated testing and linting
- ✅ Cleanup unused resources

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Portal Migration (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** Move Portal from Elastic Beanstalk to Amplify  
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Status:** Done by team (separate repo)

- ✅ Split portal into standalone repo
- ✅ Migrated to AWS Amplify
- ✅ Git-based deployments
- ✅ Decommissioned Portal EB environment

---

### 🔄 Phase 3: API Migration (IN PROGRESS) ← **WE ARE HERE**
**Goal:** Move API from Elastic Beanstalk to App Runner  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Effort:** 14-18 hours

#### Step 3.1: Create API Repo + Branches ✅ DONE
**Time:** 1 minute  
**Status:** Complete

- ✅ Created APEX-Api-Prod repository
- ✅ Created `staging` and `main` branches
- ✅ Added README.md and .gitignore
- ✅ Pushed initial structure

**Commits:**
- `2fd70ac` - chore(api): init repo structure (staging & main)

---

#### Step 3.2: Import API Code from Monorepo ✅ DONE
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Status:** Complete

- ✅ Copied API code from `~/old-app/apps/api/`
- ✅ Used rsync to exclude node_modules, dist, .env
- ✅ Imported 296 files (routes, services, middleware, migrations)
- ✅ Committed raw import to staging

**Commits:**
- `0b5387a` - feat(api): import legacy API source (pre-standalone cleanup)

---

#### Step 3.3: Make it Standalone ✅ DONE
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Status:** Complete

- ✅ Removed monorepo `extends` from tsconfig.json
- ✅ Removed `workspace:*` dependencies from package.json
- ✅ Simplified server to basic Express + /health endpoint
- ✅ Server listens on `$PORT` (default 3000)
- ✅ Verified: `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm start` all working
- ✅ Tested: GET /health returns `{"ok":true}`

**Commits:**
- `f427bdc` - chore(api): standalone tsconfig/package + basic server & /health

---

#### Step 3.4: Auth, CORS, Docker, Cleanup ✅ DONE (with corrections)
**Time:** 2 hours  
**Status:** Complete (corrected after overzealous deletion)

**Initial Implementation:**
- ✅ Added `jose` dependency for JWKS verification
- ✅ Created `src/middleware/requireAuth.ts`
- ✅ Validates: issuer, audience, token_use (access tokens only)
- ✅ Updated server with strict CORS via `CORS_ORIGIN` env
- ✅ Added protected `/secure/ping` endpoint
- ✅ Created multi-stage Dockerfile (Node 20 Alpine)
- ✅ Removed non-API artifacts (Lambda, charts, migrations, scripts)

**Correction (learned lesson):**
- ✅ Restored business logic (routes, services, db, migrations)
- ✅ Narrowed tsconfig to compile skeleton only (index + middleware)
- ✅ Added `OIDC_AUDIENCE` override for future resource servers
- ✅ Explicit CORS methods for preflight support
- ✅ Slimmed Dockerfile runtime (`npm ci --omit=dev`)
- ✅ Added `CURSOR_SCOPE.md` guardrails
- ✅ Added `docs/TRIGGERS.md` for Lambda separation

**Commits:**
- `692b71e` - chore(api): remove non-HTTP-service artifacts (Lambda, charts, migrations, scripts)
- `b9af0c9` - feat(api): JWKS auth middleware, strict CORS, /secure/ping, Dockerfile
- `dc00744` - fix: restore business logic + narrow tsconfig + harden auth/CORS + add guardrails

**Verified Locally:**
- ✅ `npm run build` - Clean (0 TypeScript errors)
- ✅ `npm start` - Server runs on port 3000
- ✅ GET /health - Returns `{"ok":true}`
- ✅ GET /secure/ping - Returns 401 (no token, expected)

#### Step 3.5: Deploy to AWS App Runner ⏳ NEXT
**Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Status:** Ready to start

**Tasks:**
1. Create ECR repository for container images
2. Build and push Docker image to ECR
3. Create App Runner service from staging branch
4. Configure environment variables:
   - `PORT=3000`
   - `OIDC_AUTHORITY=https://cognito-idp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eu-west-1_JiQF0xM04`
   - `OIDC_CLIENT_ID=6mvn1gc775h8ibei5phrkk60l1`
   - `CORS_ORIGIN=https://staging.app.nomadapex.com` (Amplify portal URL)
   - `DATABASE_URL` (from Secrets Manager)
   - Other env vars as needed
5. Configure health check: GET /health
6. Set auto-scaling: min 1, max 3 instances
7. Connect custom domain: `staging.api.nomadapex.com`
8. Update Route 53 CNAME
9. Test deployment: `curl https://staging.api.nomadapex.com/health`
10. Verify auth: `curl https://staging.api.nomadapex.com/secure/ping` (should 401)

---

#### Step 3.6: Add CloudFront (Optional) ⏳ PENDING
**Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Status:** Not started

**Tasks:**
1. Create CloudFront distribution pointing to App Runner URL
2. Configure caching policies for GET requests
3. Set up DDoS protection
4. Update custom domain to point to CloudFront
5. Update CORS to allow CloudFront domain

---

#### Step 3.7: Decommission API Elastic Beanstalk ⏳ PENDING
**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Status:** Not started

**Tasks:**
1. Verify App Runner working in production
2. Monitor for 48 hours
3. Terminate EB environment: `nomad-apex-api-prod`
4. Delete EB application
5. Clean up associated resources (S3, CloudWatch logs)

---

### ⏳ Phase 4: Documentation & Polish (PENDING)
**Goal:** Ensure maintainability and knowledge transfer  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Effort:** 12-16 hours

**Tasks:**
- Update all documentation
- Create architecture diagrams
- Setup monitoring and alerts
- Create runbooks
- Knowledge transfer session

---

## Key Decisions & Learnings

### ✅ What's Working Well
1. **Standalone repo approach** - Clear boundaries, independent versioning
2. **JWKS auth middleware** - Proper token validation with issuer/audience checks
3. **Strict CORS** - Environment-based origin control
4. **Multi-stage Docker** - Optimized for App Runner
5. **Narrow TypeScript compilation** - Build skeleton first, add features incrementally

### ⚠️ Lessons Learned
1. **Don't delete business logic to fix build errors** - Use tsconfig exclude instead
2. **Migrations are immutable** - Never delete, only add new ones
3. **Keep Lambda triggers separate** - Will move to APEX-Auth-Triggers repo
4. **Guardrails are essential** - CURSOR_SCOPE.md prevents future mistakes
5. **Incremental approach** - Skeleton first, then re-enable features step-by-step

### 🔒 Security Improvements
- JWKS-based JWT verification (no shared secrets)
- Token type validation (access tokens only)
- Audience claim verification
- Strict CORS with explicit methods/headers
- Helmet middleware for security headers
- Environment-based configuration (no hardcoded values)

## Next Immediate Actions

### 🎯 Priority 1: Deploy Staging to App Runner (Step 3.5)

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Standalone API repo with auth skeleton
- ✅ Dockerfile ready
- ✅ Local testing successful
- ⏳ AWS credentials configured
- ⏳ Secrets Manager values identified

**Steps:**
1. Create ECR repository
2. Build and push Docker image
3. Create App Runner service
4. Configure environment variables
5. Test staging deployment
6. Update DNS

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Blocker:** None (ready to proceed)

---

### 🎯 Priority 2: Re-enable Business Routes (Post-Deployment)

Once skeleton is deployed and tested:
1. Expand tsconfig to include `src/db/**`
2. Add required dependencies (pg, etc.)
3. Test database connection
4. Expand to include one route at a time
5. Deploy incrementally
