## 🚀 What You Asked For

> "ok also is the plan always twn steps it should be dynamic it shoudl make a new plan base on every prompt it kinda skips to the open ai search not ot is that just speed but yeah different plans different steps, also put it into the chat not its own scroll box"

> "if i select grphs in my report they have to be figured into th eplan"

> "keep going"

## ✅ What Was Built

### **Phase 1: Basic SSE Streaming** ✅ 
- Database migration (`o1_research_runs`, `o1_research_activities`)
- SSE endpoints (`POST /research/start`, `GET /research/stream/:id`)
- Real-time thinking events
- Portal connection verified

### **Phase 2: Real Research** ✅
- OpenAI web search integration
- APIM synthesis for reports
- File processing foundation (ADI integration)
- Robust error handling
- Dynamic step calculation

### **Dynamic Planning** ✅
- Query type detection (comparison, historical, analysis, data)
- Dynamic step calculation (5-14 steps based on complexity)
- Dynamic section generation (tailored to query type)
- **Not fixed at 10 steps anymore!**

### **Inline Display** ✅
- Removed separate scroll container
- Thinking flows naturally in chat
- Compact header design
- Border-left accents
- **No more separate thinking box!**

### **Charts Integration** ✅
- Parse `include_charts` from Portal
- Generate charts using existing ChartService
- APIM extracts chart data from findings
- Charts embedded in report markdown
- **Dynamic steps:** +1 step per chart requested

### **Phase 3: o1-Style Reasoning** ✅
- Self-critique after web search
- APIM quality assessment (1-10 score)
- Automatic pivot when quality < 6/10
- Refined search with better queries
- New thinking types: `self_critique`, `pivot`

## 🎯 Key Features

### **1. Dynamic Planning**

**Query:** "Compare React vs Vue"
```
→ Detects: Comparative analysis
→ Steps: 9 (7 base + 2 for comparison)
→ Sections: + "Comparative Analysis"
```

**Query:** "History of AI"
```
→ Detects: Historical research
→ Steps: 9 (7 base + 2 for timeline)
→ Sections: + "Historical Context"
```

**Query:** "What is ML?" + charts: `['bar', 'line']`
```
→ Detects: Informational + 2 charts
→ Steps: 9 (7 base + 2 for charts)
→ Sections: Standard + "Visualizations"
```

---

### **2. o1-Style Self-Critique**

**Example Flow:**
```
[Tool Call] openai_search → Search web
[Result] Found 3 items
[Thinking] Evaluating quality... (self_critique)
[Thinking] Quality: 4/10. Generic results, need more specifics. (self_critique)
[Thinking] Pivoting: Using more specific search terms... (pivot)
[Tool Call] openai_search_refined → Refined search
[Result] Found 7 additional items
[Thinking] Quality: 8/10. Comprehensive coverage. (self_critique)
```

**Adaptive:**
- Low quality (< 6/10) → Pivot → Refined search
- High quality (>= 6/10) → Proceed to report

---

### **3. Charts in Reports**

**User selects:** `['bar', 'pie']`

**API generates:**
```markdown
## Visualizations

### Bar Chart
![bar visualization](/api/charts/serve/abc123.png)

### Pie Chart  
![pie visualization](/api/charts/serve/def456.png)
```

**Portal displays:** Embedded chart images in markdown report

---

### **4. Inline Thinking Display**

**Before:** Separate scroll box (max-height: 500px)  
**Now:** Flows naturally in chat message

**User sees:**
```
✓ Planning research approach... 7 steps

  04:10:23 PM Planning
  Analyzing your query to determine the best research approach...
  
  04:10:24 PM Planning
  Query type: Informational research. Planning 7 research steps.
  
  🔧 04:10:25 PM Tool Call
  openai_search - Search public web
  
  ✅ 04:10:27 PM Result
  openai_search → Found 8 items
  
  ... (continues in chat naturally)
```

## 📊 Production-Grade Standards

✅ **Database:** PostgreSQL with proper indexes, JSONB columns  
✅ **Security:** JWT authentication, APIM for sensitive data, OpenAI for public  
✅ **Performance:** Parallel tool calls, efficient SSE streaming  
✅ **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks, never crashes, comprehensive logging  
✅ **TypeScript:** Full type safety, no `any` types where avoidable  
✅ **Kevin's Plan:** Aligns with AWS App Runner deployment strategy  
✅ **Documentation:** Comprehensive `.context/` docs for each phase

## 🧪 Testing

### **Try This Query:**
```
Query: "Break down AI adoption trends in enterprise 2025"
Depth: Medium
Charts: Bar, Line
```

**Expected Flow:**
1. Planning → "Informational research. Planning 9 research steps." (7 base + 2 charts)
2. Tool Call → openai_search
3. Result → Found X items
4. Self-Critique → "Evaluating quality..."
   - If quality low → Pivot → Refined search
   - If quality good → Proceed
5. Thinking → "Generating 2 charts..."
6. Tool Call → chart_generator (bar)
7. Tool Call → chart_generator (line)
8. Synthesis → Generate report
9. Completed → Report with charts
