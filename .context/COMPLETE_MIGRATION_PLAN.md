## 🚨 Risk Management

### Known Risks
1. **Database connections** - May need to add DB connection pooling
2. **Environment variables** - Must verify all from Secrets Manager
3. **CORS configuration** - Must match exact portal domains
4. **Auto-scaling** - May need tuning after initial deployment
5. **Cost monitoring** - Watch for unexpected charges

### Mitigation Plans
1. Keep old EB running for 48hrs (easy rollback)
2. Monitor CloudWatch metrics closely
3. Test thoroughly on staging first
4. Have team on standby during cutover
5. Document rollback procedure
