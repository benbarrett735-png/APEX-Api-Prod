---

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed Today

### 1. **Charts Chat/Regeneration - `full_report` Column Error**
**Issue:** `Error: column "full_report" does not exist`

**Root Cause:** 
- `agentic_runs` table doesn't have a `full_report` column
- Chart data stored in `agentic_artifacts` table

**Fix:**
- ✅ Modified chat endpoint to query `agentic_artifacts`
- ✅ Modified regeneration to read from `agentic_artifacts`
- ✅ Fixed SQL bug: `WHERE id` → `WHERE run_id`
- ✅ Feedback now injected into goal for regeneration

**Files Changed:**
- `src/routes/agentic-flow.ts` (lines 510-555, 623-697)

---

### 2. **Charts Fallback Logic - Missing Data Handling**
**Issue:** Charts failed when data didn't match chart type

**Fix:**
- ✅ Added web search fallback if context < 500 chars
- ✅ Updated APIM system prompt to generate synthetic data
- ✅ Charts now work even with insufficient real data

**Files Changed:**
- `src/routes/reports.ts` (lines 790-807)
- `src/services/chartService.ts` (lines 1595-1598)

---

### 3. **Reports Chart Failures - Crash Instead of Continue**
**Issue:** Single chart failure crashed entire report generation

**Fix:**
- ✅ Added try-catch around chart generation
- ✅ Failed charts now added as placeholder with error message
- ✅ Report shows "⚠️ Chart Generation Failed" instead of crashing
- ✅ Report continues and completes

**Files Changed:**
- `src/routes/reports.ts` (lines 817-868, 953-969)

---

### 4. **Research Regeneration - Used Fallback Plan**
**Issue:** Regeneration ignored feedback and used generic fallback plan

**Fix:**
- ✅ Added check: if APIM fails during regeneration → throw error
- ✅ Prevents generic fallback that ignores feedback
- ✅ Shows "🔄 Regenerating with your feedback..." message
- ✅ Runs through full thinking/tool execution flow

**Files Changed:**
- `src/routes/research.ts` (lines 219-223, 1060-1070)

---

### 5. **Research Chat - No Conversation History**
**Issue:** Chat only supported single messages, not conversations

**Fix:**
- ✅ Added `chatHistory` parameter support
- ✅ Builds messages array with full conversation context
- ✅ Multi-turn conversations now work

**Files Changed:**
- `src/routes/research.ts` (lines 1613, 1689-1711)

---

### 6. **Research Stream Crash - JSON Parse Error** 🔥 **CRITICAL**
**Issue:** Research (and regeneration) crashed immediately with:
```
SyntaxError: "[object Object]" is not valid JSON
```

**Root Cause:**
- Database returned `uploaded_files` as empty object `{}`
- Code tried to `JSON.parse({})` → crashed
- Stream died before any research started

**Fix:**
- ✅ Added proper type checking before JSON.parse
- ✅ Handles: arrays, strings, objects, null
- ✅ Applied to both `uploaded_files` and `include_charts`
- ✅ No more crashes on malformed data

**Files Changed:**
- `src/routes/research.ts` (lines 1023-1063)

**Impact:** This bug was breaking BOTH normal research AND regeneration!
